Garden Party

Java Springboot Thymeleaf

This app uses a database.  I've always used MySQL ran on local host.

You will have to register a user.

You can add different plants and choose a plant icon to represent it.

Then you will create a garden with some garden beds.

Beds are made up of plots.

So each bed can have a different number of plots.

Then you can add your plants do the plots.

Most everything should be clear once you get running.

There is admin functionality that will allow you to add more icon sources 

Admin is manually set via database (you likely will not need to mess with this unless you want to add icons via the admin menu)
